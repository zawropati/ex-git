  <pre>EXERCISE
    npm install -g svgo
    https://www.npmjs.com/package/svgo
    
    Used to optimize/minify SVG's, this time you take a look at the documentation
    
     
    
    Beware, SVGO is destructive, meaning it will overwrite your file
    
    You "know" git and you "know" why it's important
    
    Do you think git is hard?
    
    git in the terminal
    
    WHAT DO YOU KNOW/REMEMBER?
    Needed
    clone
    push
    pull
    add
    commit
    For later
    fork
    branch
    merge
    .gitignore
    REALLY NEW JS STUFF
    Node.style
    With this bad boy, we can set CSS through JS, don't overdo it!!
    
    What about specificity?
    
    JS always wins
    
    Did you read the article?
    
    WHAT "WE'LL" BUILD
    A lot of "bubbles", let's say 300
    When you click one it moves to a random position on the screen
    And changes color
    How do we proceed?
    
    Focus is on git and the terminal, not on how the specific parts work
    
    Everything will be recorded
    
    TASK LIST
    create a git repository
    locally or on github?
    setup our html, css & js
    Create the bubbles
    In HTML or JS?
    Hook up eventListeners
    On event: create random values
    On event: animate</pre>
